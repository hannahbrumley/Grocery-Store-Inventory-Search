# Grocery Store Inventory Search

Simple web project that demonstrates a small inventory search UI with a PHP backend. Built as a coursework/practice project.

Summary
- A lightweight inventory search application (frontend + PHP backend).
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- Backend: PHP (search endpoint).
- Purpose: demonstrate UI layout, client-side scripting, form handling, and basic server-side search logic.

What’s included
- index.html — Main search page (user interface).
- results.html — Results page template / display.
- script.js — Frontend logic for the main page (handles form, inputs, UI behavior).
- resultsScript.js — Frontend logic for results page (renders/filters results, UI interactions).
- search.php — Server-side search handler (receives search requests and returns results).
- styles.css — Styling for pages.

Notes
- Files are self-contained and include inline comments explaining the code and approach — open any .js or .php file to view details.
- The project is intentionally small and focused on demonstrating:
  - Frontend UI implementation (HTML/CSS/JS)
  - Client-server interaction with PHP
  - Basic data handling and rendering on the client

Skills demonstrated
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, event handling)
- HTML/CSS layout and responsive basics
- PHP backend handling and simple search logic
- Full-stack thinking: connecting front-end UI with server endpoint
